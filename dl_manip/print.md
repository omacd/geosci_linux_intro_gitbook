# Printing files

To quickly print a file from the command line you can use the `lp` suite of commands.

`lp file.txt` prints `file.txt`

`lpq` shows your print queue. Notice that each print job is given a job number.

`lprm 23456` removes job number `23456` from the queue.

Once you have used `lp` to print a file, you can go to any GeoSciences printer and print the file on A4 paper as from a Windows machine, using the Cloud Print service.
