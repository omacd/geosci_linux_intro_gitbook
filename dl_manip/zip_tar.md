# Compressing .zip and .tar files

If you haven't already done so, open ftp and download `jefferson.tar.gz` from the GeoSciences ftp server using these commands. When prompted, your username should be `anonymous` and the password should be your university email address, `e.g. s1234567@sms.ed.ac.uk`\):

```text
cd ~/Downloads

ftp

open ftp.geos.ed.ac.uk

cd pub/geos/wkzero

get jefferson.tar.gz

bye
```

See the section on Downloading over FTP to learn more about this.

The file we just downloaded \(`jefferson.tar.gz`\) came as a compressed binary file. A compressed file takes up less drive space than a raw file, so is ideal for sending data over the network, but we can't do anything with this file until we uncompress it. We know it is a compressed file because the file extension contains `.gz`. We can use the GunZip program \(`gzip`\) to uncompress the file:

```text
gzip -d jefferson.tar.gz
```

Note that the `-d` flag was used to tell `gzip` that we want to decompress the file. Now `ls` to see that `jefferson.tar.gz` has become `jefferson.tar`.

Now you have uncompressed the file, but it is still archived – it is one file that contains many other files, like a `.zip` file. To remove this last layer of compression and make the files usable we can use `tar`:

```text
tar -xf jefferson.tar
```

The `-x` flag tells `tar` that we want to extract files from an archive. The `-f` flag tells `tar` that we will provide a filename as the archive to extract from.

If you encounter `.zip` files instead of `.tar` files you can use the `zip` and `unzip` programs to compress and uncompress them. The following compresses `jefferson.txt` into `jefferson.zip`:

```text
zip jefferson.zip jefferson.txt
```

The following unzips the contents of `jefferson.zip` and places it in a directory called `jefferson_2`

```text
unzip jefferson.zip –d jefferson_2
```
