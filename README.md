# University of Edinburgh - School of GeoSciences Linux Environment

## Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to become familiar with the UNIX based computing systems in the School of GeoSciences.

The operating system of a computer is the low level software which provides the basic functions in a computer. All the other software on the computer is built on top of the operating system. The majority of computers at the University of Edinburgh run a modified version of the Windows operating system.

For common tasks, Windows is fine, but many advanced users will require an operating system which is more flexible. For those users, the School of GeoSciences provides a number of machines which run UNIX based operating systems. UNIX based operating systems give much more control to the user compared with a Windows operating system.

The specific variant of UNIX that the GeoSciences machines run is called Linux.

Why are UNIX based operating systems useful in academia?

* You can easily tell the computer what to do by typing commands in the command line, rather than pointing and clicking. Using the command line allows you to quickly repeat complex actions by simply copying the text, whereas on a point and click interface you would have to repeat all the clicks one after another. Minimising repeated clicking also decreases the chance of clicking on the wrong thing, reducing potential errors in your analyses.
* Much of the software available on UNIX operating systems is free and open source, meaning that everybody has access to the code used to create it. This means that you know exactly what the program is doing in the background, making it easier for your research to be [reproduced by others](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/56/12/958/221622).

Students use the GeoSciences UNIX systems for a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:

* Simulation modelling
* GIS and mapping
* Running an email server
* Statistical programming

While this workshop is not designed to be a definitive reference for all things UNIX, it should provide a good introduction from which you can continue to learn about this powerful computing resource.

All the introduction materials, including the raw files for this [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), can be found here:

```

Either work through the chapters in this book sequentially, or choose a specific topic you would like to learn more about.

At the end of the book there is a Quicklook Table with examples of all the commands used in the book, which you can use as a reference later on.

## By the end of this workshop you should be able to:

* Log on to any UNIX machine in the School of GeoSciences
* Locate your home directory
* Perform simple file operations on the command line using, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
* View plain text files in a number of different ways using "pagers" and "editors"
* Find help on commands/programs using `man` pages
* Download and retrieve data via FTP
* Monitor memory usage, and find out about other users on the system using `finger`, `ps`, `kill`
* Search within files using `grep`
* Connect to the GeoSciences Linux server using a graphical client
* Map GeoSciences network drives to your personal computer
* Tell other people how awesome UNIX is
