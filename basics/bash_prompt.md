# The Bash prompt

By this point you should be connected to the Linux `burn` server using whatever means suits you, if not, go back and try again, using one of the Command Line options in the login section. When you first login you should be presented with a terminal window looks something like this:

```text
[s1234567@burn ~]$ â– 
```

This innocuous line, known as the bash prompt actually tells us some really useful information:

* `s1234567` is obviously your UUN, letting you know you are logged in.
* `burn` is the hostname, i.e. the name of the server you are connected to.
* `~` Is the directory you are currently in, `~` is shorthand for the home directory.
* `$` marks the end of the bash prompt and the start of the space where you can type commands.

When you type a command it will appear to the right of the `$`, when you want have typed a command and want to run it, press "Enter".
