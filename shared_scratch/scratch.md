# Scratch space

Another shared space that will be useful is `/scratch/s1234567`, obviously your scratch space will be named after your own UUN. Scratch space offers a very large amount of temporary storage space. It is not backed up so don't leave anything important on there for too long, but it could be useful if you want somewhere to unpack a huge dataset, or create lots of model objects.

To move to your scratch space just type the following, switching out `s1234567` with your own UUN:

```text
cd /scratch/s1234567
```
