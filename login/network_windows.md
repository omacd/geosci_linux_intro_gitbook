# Adding a network drive - personal Windows

You can access your files on the University computers, such as those located in your `M:` drive, without needing to connect to the GeoSciences Linux servers. This is especially useful for accessing things out of hours.

First, make sure you are connected to the University VPN service \([more information can be found here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn)\).

Then click `Start`, `Computer`.

Click `Map Network Drive`

Pick an available letter, e.g. `G`

Enter the folder address as:

```text
\\students.geos.ed.ac.uk\s1234567
```

replacing `s1234567` with your own UUN.

You can use the same method as above to add the "Research DataStore" as a network drive, which gives every research student and staff member 500GB of backed up storage space. The address to add is:

```text
\\csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk\csce\geos\users\s1234567
```

replacing `s1234567` with your own UUN.
