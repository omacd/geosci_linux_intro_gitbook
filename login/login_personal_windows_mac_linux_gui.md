Give the connection a sensible name

Select the new connection from the list on the main menu, click `Connect` and select a desktop environment such as `KDE`. Desktop environments merely affect the way the desktop is presented, the colour of the window borders and application icons etc. All the underlying functionality of Linux will remain exactly the same regardless of the desktop environment.
