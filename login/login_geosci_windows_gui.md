# GUI - GeoSciences Windows

Open "NX Connection Wizard" from the Start menu.

Configure the connection like so:

* "Session" = `burn.geos.ed.ac.uk`
* "Host" = `burn.geos.ed.ac.uk`
* "Port" = `22`
* "Select type of your internet connection." = `ADSL`
* "Client" = `Unix`
* "Desktop environment" = `KDE` - **This can be changed if you want**
* "Select size of your remote desktop" = `Available area` - **This can be changed if you want**

Then when the login window appears, login with your UUN \(e.g. `s1234567`\) and the password you use to login to MyEd.
